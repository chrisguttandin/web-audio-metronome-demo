        <p>This is a demo of a metronome which uses the Web Audio API to achieve a very high precision. It's basically following the technique described by <a href="https://paul.cx">Paul Adenot</a> in his blogpost named <a href="https://blog.paul.cx/post/metronome">"A robust metronome using the Web Audio API"</a>. The metronome is connected to a <a href="https://github.com/chrisguttandin/timing-object">timing-object</a> which is itself connected to a <a href="https://github.com/chrisguttandin/timing-provider">timing-provider</a>. That means multiple instances of this page should be in sync with each other.</p>
